    <p>Samurai (侍、さむらい) were the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from
        the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s during the Meiji era. They were the well-paid
        retainers of the daimyo, the great feudal landholders. They had high prestige and special privileges. </p>
    <p>One of the most recognisable symbols of that era and samurai tradition is the samurai armor.</p>

    <h3 id="#Kabuto">Kabuto-helmet</h3>
    <p>Kabuto (兜, 冑) is a type of helmet first used by ancient Japanese warriors which, in later periods, became an
        important part of the traditional Japanese armour worn by the samurai class and their retainers in feudal Japan.
    </p>

    <p> Note that in the Japanese language, the word kabuto is an appellative, not a type description, and can refer to
        any combat helmet.

        Every year on Children's Day, May 5, Japanese households display miniature kabuto and samurai armor in keeping
        with the tradition of Tango no Sekku. In feudal times, real samurai armor, kabuto, and tachi were displayed.

    <p>Dō or dou (胴) "breastplate, cuirass" is one of the major components of Japanese armour worn by the samurai and
        ashigaru or foot soldiers of feudal Japan.
    </p>

    <p>The predecessor of the dō was manufactured in Japan as early as the fourth century. Tankō, worn by foot soldiers,
        and keikō, worn by horsemen, were both pre-samurai types of early Japanese cuirass constructed from iron plates
        connected by leather thongs.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="samuraiScheme">Back to top</a>
    </p>

    <p>The type of dō that originally came with a matched suit of armour defined the name for that particular suit of
        armour, for example, a suit of armour that came with a hotoke dō would be called a hotoke dō gusoku; a suit of
        armour that came with a karuta tatami dō would be called a karuta tatami dō gusoku.

    <h3 id="Kusazuri-armored skirt">Kusazuri-armored skirt</h3>

    <p>Kusazuri are a skirt of plates attached to a leather belt which is laced to the bottom of the dou (dō). The
        kusazuri protect the hips, groin, and posterior. Made from black-lacquered iron plates tied together, the armour
        was flexible, allowing its wearer to move freely. The armoured skirt, c, shields the thighs, while the arm
        coverings combine protective chain mail with fine silk.

    <h3 id="Haldate-thight guard">Haldate-thight guard</h3>

    <p>Armored samurai thigh guard (kawara haidate) of overlapping plates. The two joined panels hang below the cuirass
        to protect the thighs. The shape of each panel is oval or egg-shaped, with the upper section being wider than
        the lower.

    </p>

    <p>The exterior fabric is of tan cloth with tan brocade in an ivy pattern. The upper sections have strips of
        reinforcing leather (chikara-gawa) from the upper edges to the mid-point, then a horizontal strip from one side
        to the other. Large holes toward the inner sides of the thigh guards (muchisashi-no-ana) are surrounded by a
        different, blue and white, patterned reinforcing leather and serve to hold the wearer's riding crop.

    <h3 id="Suneate-Shin guard">Suneate-Shin guard</h3>

    <p> Shino Suneate (Light)-Shin guards that consist of splint plates and are connected by Kisari (chainmail), with a
        cloth backing. The cloth hiza (knee) would often have some padding and kikko (hexagon plates) for added
        protection. The shino suneate (light) where typically worn by light cavalry and would have featured leather
        padding on the inside calf to avoid chafing the horse (Ichi Hiza). Foot soldier samurai, would have used the
        straight splints without the leather, affording them a little more protection (Light Mittsu Hiza Suneate).
