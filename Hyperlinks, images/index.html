    <p>Janet: Hi. Cookie?
        <a href="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/family-guy/3/3e/Stewie-griffin-20090326035423471_640w.jpg?width=325"
            alt="Stewie Griffin" target="_blank">Stewie Griffin</a>
        : Well, it's Stewie, but... you can call me "cookie" if you like. Yes, I also answer to "Artemis, " "Agent
        Buckwald" and "Snake." Yes, I rather like "Snake." Snake Griffin. [wiggles his tongue like a snake] UPS Woman:
        I've got a package for Glen Quagmire.
        <a href="./assets/images/Glenn_Quagmire.png" target="_blank" alt="Quagmire">Quagmire</a>
        : I'll be right back [Closes door, then returns a moment later, naked]
        <a href="./assets/images/Glenn_Quagmire.png" target="_blank" alt="Quagmire">Quagmire</a>
        : And I've got a
        package for you too! Oh! [she maces him]
        <a href="./assets/images/Glenn_Quagmire.png" target="_blank" alt="Quagmire">Quagmire</a>
        : Nice try, but I've built up an immunity. Brian Griffin: You're really going to
        take back donated gifts on Christmas Eve? Peter Griffin: Yes, now here's the plan. We'll enter through the air
        conditioning duct here. Which will be guarded by lasers three inches above the floor, now you'll have to squeeze
        yourself to the size of about a sponge and then crawl across the floor like a dolphin or some other amphibious
        mammal. Brian: Can I buy some pot from you? Peter Griffin: At least they don't put their feminine ointments next
        to the mustard, Lois. That was the worst hot dog I ever ate. Pearl Burton: What is this, spit soup? Brian: It's
        tomato bisque. Pearl Burton: What is this, snot soup? Brian: It's tomato bisque! Pearl Burton: What is this,
        diarrhea soup? Stewie Griffin: Make sure there's a fresh copy of Wall Street Journal next to the changing table.
        Old Woman: Aw, look at you! I bet you're hungry.

        : And I bet your lost your virginity to a mechanical
        bull. Now change me! Death: You can't tell anyone that I'm here. For if you do, the consequences could be dire.
        Peter Griffin: Go on... Death: That's it. [to Lois] Death: God, what do you see in him? Chris Griffin: Where do
        you think you go when you die? Southern boy: I learned from church that if you're good you go to heaven but if
        you're bad, you go to a place where the dead believe they're still living and they pray for death but death
        won't come. Chris Griffin: UPN? Lois Griffin: Peter, I saw a really good deal on a used car in this newspaper.
        Peter Griffin: Oh no. I knew a guy who bought a used car through a newspaper. Ten years later, BAM! Herpes. Tom
        Tucker: Due to an accident today at the Quahog Cable Company, all television transmissions will be out for an
        undetermined ammount of time. Of course no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we
        say. I'm the lord Jesus Christ. I think I'll go get drunk and beat up some midgets. How about you, Diane? Diane
        Simmons: Well Tom, I just plain don't like black people. [they laugh] Cameraman: You guys, we're still on in
        Boston. [Tom and Diane stare in horror] Luke Skywalker: Okay I'll just make a quick incision here and we'll be
        all done, Mrs. Wilson. Ben Kenobi: Luke, use the Force. Luke Skywalker: Really? Because I was just gonna... Ben
        Kenobi: Just use the Force. Luke Skywalker: Okay! [Luke's lightsaber floats above Mrs. Wilson and stabs her
        right through the eye. She starts screaming] Luke Skywalker: Are you happy? Ben Kenobi: I've never been happy.
        Glen Quagmire: I felt guilty once, but she woke up halfway through. Tom Tucker: I think I speak for everyone
        when I say, New York and everyone from there can fornicate themselves with an iron stick. Peter Griffin: If you
        could be stranded on a desert island with any woman in the world, who would it be? Glen Quagmire: Taylor Hanson.
        Joe Swanson: Taylor Hanson is a guy. Glen Quagmire: [laughs] You guys are yankin' me. "Hey, let's put one over
        on Quagmire." Peter Griffin: No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire. Glen Quagmire: What? That's insane. That's
        impossible. [pause] Glen Quagmire: Oh god. Oh my god. I've got all these magazines. Oh god. Peter Griffin:
        [posing as Britney Spears] How about a kiss, Justin? Justin Timberlake: Uh, sure, Britney. [they kiss, and Peter
        transforms] Justin Timberlake: Aaahh! Peter Griffin: He, he, he, he! I'm Gene Shalit now. [upon finding out the
        local bar has been turned into a British pub] Peter Griffin: Holy crap. It's a gay bar. [we see a flashback of
        Stewie with a normal, round head, jumping up and down on the bed] Stewie: I can jump on the bed all I want.
        You're not my mother. [Stewie hits his head on the ceiling, squashing it into its more familiar rugby-ball
        shape] Brian Griffin: Oh my God, are you all right? Stewie: Fine. Why do you ask? Lois Griffin: Peter! Peter
        Griffin: Um... Lee Majors said it. Lee Majors: What? Women are things. Glen Quagmire: Fat chicks need lovin too,
        but they gotta pay.
